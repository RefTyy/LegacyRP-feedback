**Summary:**
2 days ago i lost about 25k randomly from my pockets the next day i logged in. i first tought it was an invoice/fine from the police that i 
forgot to pay. but as i logged out yesterday and in today. i went from around 144k to 115k again i lost money from nothing.
The only thing i bought was a phone and a gun back around 6-10k - from what i had so i know i had at least 140k before logging out yesterday
because i died in a store robbery. everyone included in the store robbery died and there were no ems so we all agreed to respawn.


**Steps to Reproduce:**
